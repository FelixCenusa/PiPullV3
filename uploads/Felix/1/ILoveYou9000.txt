And I won't let you fall
I won't let you go
No matter where you are
No matter where you are, I'll be there
No matter where you are
No matter where you are, I'll be there
I will hold on to everything we've got
A quitter and regretter and forgetter is everything I'm not
I'll take care of you, love you just because
You and I are better than forever, nothing can stop us
